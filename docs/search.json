    "text": "Archiving Federal Environmental Data (Nost et al., 2024)\nThe Environmental Data & Governance Initiative (EDGI) documented how the Trump administration deleted Clean Power Plan webpages, calculators, and fact sheets months before formally proposing repeal. This is a clear example of reporting bias and suppression, where inconvenient data were removed from public view. The impact was significant where communities and policymakers lost access to tools that quantified emissions and incentives, undermining transparency and accountability. Archiving efforts like EDGI’s highlight the importance of preserving not only data sets but also their metadata and narratives."

    "text": "Louisiana Bucket Brigade (Walker et al., 2018; Vera et al., 2019)\nIn Louisiana, state monitors averaged toxic emissions over 24‑hour periods, masking short‑term spikes in pollution near chemical facilities. Community members responded by developing “air buckets” to capture peak exposures. This case illustrates measurement bias, where methodological choices obscured hazards. Official data understated health risks, while community‑generated data revealed the lived realities of fence‑line communities-communities that are immediately adjacent to highly polluting facilities. The Bucket Brigade demonstrates how participatory monitoring can counteract these biases and disseminate environmental knowledge."

    "text": "Indigenous Health Statistics (Walter & Suina, 2019)\nIndigenous statistics in settler nation states often emphasize difference, disparity, disadvantage, dysfunction, and deprivation—the so‑called “5D data.” This framing positions Indigenous peoples primarily through deficit narratives, a form of outcome reporting bias and deficit framing bias. The implication is that this data reinforces colonial logics/frameworks and obscure Indigenous lifeworlds of wellness, which include spirituality, language, and community well‑being. Walter and Suina argue for specifically Indigenous quantitative methodologies and data sovereignty to disrupt these deficit narratives and ensure the data reflect Indigenous priorities and values."

    "text": "Biodiversity Monitoring (Young et al., 2014)\nThe global biodiversity data sets disproportionately represent birds and mammals, while insects, fungi, and plants are under counted. This is a classic case of sampling bias, where certain species are “privileged” or prioritized in monitoring efforts. The impact is unbalanced conservation priorities that neglect less visible but ecologically critical organisms. Young and colleagues emphasize the need for interdisciplinary dialogue and more inclusive monitoring strategies that reflect the complexity of the ecosystems and the relevance of policy ."

    "text": "Biases in Environmental Causal Inference (Konno et al., 2024)\nThis journal identified 121 types of bias relevant to environmental research, including confounding and selection bias. For example, in agricultural studies, management practices may confound relationships between soil moisture, sunlight, and crop yields. Even well‑designed studies can mislead if variables are not accounted for. Konno and colleagues highlight the importance of utilizing critical appraisal tools to identify and mitigate biases in causal inference, ensuring that environmental interventions are based on valid evidence."
