In the following years, I was an AmeriCorps Vista volunteer in Hawaii and worked on environmental policy for the Caldwell Administration and co-developed the methodology for the City and County of Honolulu’s first greenhouse gas inventory as well as develop metrics for its first sustainability report. After, I was a Peace Corps volunteer in the country of Georgia where I provided capacity to a small non-government organization providing support in IT, translation, database development, data dashboard and website development and youth development project facilitation."
