::: {#bio}

Welcome! I’m a graduate student in Environmental Data Science at UCSB, specializing in geospatial analysis, reproducible workflows, and creative approaches to teaching data science. My background spans data cleaning, climate research, and visualization.

I earned dual degrees in Environmental Studies & Planning and Economics from Sonoma State University in 2017. Since then, I’ve served as an AmeriCorps VISTA in Hawaii, where I worked on environmental policy for the Caldwell Administration and helped develop Honolulu’s first greenhouse gas inventory and sustainability metrics. Later, as a Peace Corps volunteer in Georgia, I supported a local NGO with IT, translation, database and dashboard development, and youth project facilitation.
