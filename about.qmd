## What I do for fun

In my free time, I enjoy film photography, cooking, playing guitar and going camping in my Volkswagen.

You can find me enjoying my collection of vinyl records. My favorite cuisine is Thai food. Among Thai food, drunken noodles, larb and yellow curry are among my favorite dishes. However, my all time favorite dish is the Japanese Ramen, specifically Tsukemen.
